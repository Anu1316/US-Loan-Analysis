🟢 Loan Performance
Loan Status Distribution:
The majority of loans (94.62%) are fully paid, indicating a healthy repayment rate. Only 3.84% were charged off, and a small portion are current. This reflects strong loan performance and possibly conservative underwriting practices.

Loan Grades:
Most loans fall under grades B (30.46%) and A (24.8%), which are considered low-to-moderate risk. Higher-risk grades like F and G make up a very small fraction, showing limited exposure to high-risk borrowers.
